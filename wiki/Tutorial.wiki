#summary This is a brief tutorial on DEUS.

= Introduction =

Each release contains sources (in the src/ folder), docs and examples.
Sources include the following packages:

  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.core (core interfaces and classes, such as Event, Node, Process)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.impl.event (implementation of common events, such as node birth)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.impl.node (implementation of basic node classes)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.impl.process (implementation of common processes, such as Poisson)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.impl.resource (implementation of basic resource classes)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.p2p.event (P2P-specific events, such as connection)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.p2p.node (P2P-specific node types, such as Peer)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.schema (classes that map DEUS schema)
  * it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.util (utility classes)

We suggest to import deus in Eclipse and to run the simulations from there.

Project: deus

Main Class: it.unipr.ce.dsg.deus.automator.gui.DeusAutomatorFrame

Program Arguments: 
the first parameter passed is the path of the XML configuration file, while the second is the name of the XML file that will be generated by the Automator  

VM Arguments: -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties -Xms256M -Xmx1000M


Once the DEUS Automator GUI has loaded, you can configure which node paramaters, processes, etc. to vary in order to create many different simulations from the XML configuration file (that was introduced as first program argument).

For example, if a node has an integer parameter "x", you can add in the Node Parameter panel a rule to make "x" vary from an initial value, let say 1, to a final value, let say 5, with a step, e.g. 1. Then you can "Save" this configuration in a text file, to be reused in the future. If you press the "Run" button, 5 simulations are sequentially executed (one for each value of "x"). You can also set several seeds, other than default one, thus if you set 2 seeds, the number of simulations becomes 10.  

Very important is the "GnuPlot File" panel. Here you can define files in which to put bidimensional data to be plotted. 

For example, suppose that you have Logger that periodically computes the value of a variable "y". You can define a file (call it yVariation.txt, for example) with X label "VT" (virtual time) and Y Label "y". Then, after each simulation, you will have a yVariation.txt file reporting the values of y (first column) with respect to virtual time (second column).
